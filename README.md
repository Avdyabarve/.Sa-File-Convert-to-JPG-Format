# .Sa-File-Convert-to-JPG-Format
I created a secret album on my phone to store pictures, but after my phone was damaged, I recovered most data except for those in the album. The files have a ".SA" extension, and I haven't found any information online about converting them. If anyone knows how to access or convert these files, or has resources that could help, I would appreciate.
